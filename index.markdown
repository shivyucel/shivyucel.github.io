#### Hello! I am currently a DPhil candidate at the School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford. I am interested in studying socio-spatial inequalities and human mobility using data science techniques. I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Toronto in economics, and finished an MSc in Social Data Science from the University of Oxford. On this website you can find some of my recent projects, publications, and my CV -- have a browse and reach out if you would like to chat!
